The Recipe Management System is a full-stack web application developed using C# and ASP.NET MVC architecture. It features two primary roles: Admin and Client (Customer). The Admin side allows authorized users to perform full CRUD operations on recipes, contests, and announcements. Admins can categorize recipes as either Free or Premium, and manage all content through a secure and structured interface. On the Client side, users can browse and view free recipes without registration, while premium recipes are accessible after purchasing a membership. Clients can also view announcements and participate in contests created by admins. The system uses SQL Server for data management, follows a clean MVC architecture, and includes a responsive user interface for both admin and customer experiences. This project showcases key concepts in full-stack development, including route protection, role-based content access, and a real-world content management workflow.
